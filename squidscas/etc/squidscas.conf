# Global configuration
####

# Maximum size of a file that may be scanned. Any file bigger that this value
# will not be scanned. If libarchive support is enable the value must be upper
# than banmaxsize otherwise this is the value of banmaxsize that will be taken.
maxsize 100M

# When a virus is found then redirect the user to this URL. If this directive
# is disabled squidclamav will use c-icap error templates to report issues.
redirect https://auth.example.com/pub/error.cgi

# Set the timeout for clamd connection. Default is 1 second, this is a good
# value but if you have slow service you can increase up to 3.
timeout 1

# Enable / disable DNS lookup of client ip address. Default is enabled '1' to
# preserve backward compatibility but you must desactivate this feature if you
# don't use trustclient with hostname in the regexp or if you don't have a DNS
# on your network. Disabling it will also speed up squidclamav.
dnslookup 1

# SquidClamav can be run in two mode. The first and default one is the
# "ScanAllExcept" mode that will scan everything by default and can be
# controlled by the abort, abortcontent, whitelist, trustuser and
# trustclient directives. The second mode is "ScanNothingExcept" that
# will scan nothing but the content controlled by the scan, scancontent,
# blacklist, untrustuser and untrustclient directives.
